The OBJ folder will hold objects that are both passed back and forth between the DAL and the BLL.

In this case, the Objects will also markup information explaining how they are stored in the database.  

However, logic to actually put them in/out of the database will be in the DAL.

These objects can act entirely stand alone as regular PHP Objects.
